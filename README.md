# 🎮 Say It & Play It – A Real-Time Voice-Controlled Game Experience  

A fun, interactive Python-based game where your *voice* becomes the controller.  
Developed as part of our **Innovative Product Development (IPD)**

## 🚀 Overview  

**Say It & Play It** is an AI-powered mini-game inspired by the classic Chrome Dino, but with a twist —  
you control the character entirely using **voice commands** like `jump`, `duck`, or `go`.
